        We were addicted to video gamesâ€¦
        <br />
        <br />
        â€¦to the point where we were playing 4+ hours a day! If even one of those
        hours had been spent studying, life would have been less stressful.
        <br />
        <br />
        But studying was always a drag, and we never had to force ourselves to
        play games. So we continued to procrastinateâ€¦
        <br />
        <br />
        Then we discovered the neuroscience behind studying: how to learn more
        in less time, and how to stay focused and consistent. These study skills
        got us into medical school, where we continued to battle-test our
        methods. Who would have thought that two video game addicts would one
        day become doctors??
        <br />
        <br />
        Study Skills helped us rediscover our love for learning, and we want to
        spread that message. Yet so most students go through school never being
        taught how to learn. This is why weâ€™ve made it our mission to make this
        information free to the public so that every student in the world can
        reach their full potential.
        <br />
        <br /> But simply having the knowledge is not enough. The hard part is
        figuring out how to apply it and change your life.
        <br />
        <br /> This is why Study Quest was created.
        <br /> By combining learning science with gamification theory and
        digital tools (like Notion and Discord), we built a study system thatâ€™s
        both effective and fun. Today, we help thousands of students around the
        world do the same with Study Quest ðŸš€.
